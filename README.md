# Text-to-Image-Generation
## Project Idea
The project aims to develop an advanced text-to-image generation system capable of creating high-quality, realistic images from natural language descriptions. We will combine multiple datasets, preprocess and clean them, and train or fine-tune state-of-the-art models such as Stable Diffusion. The goal is to explore how deep learning can bridge the gap between textual concepts and visual representations, enabling applications in areas like design, education, entertainment, and content creation.
